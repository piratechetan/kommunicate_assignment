If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you
will choose as your partner and why?

As you well know, in starting a software company,we need to:

1. Learn about programming and business.

2.Work for a software company in a management capacity.

3.Generate a product idea.




I want to choose 2 people from my batch. I will choose:

1. Subham (my classmate) because he has a vast knowledge of web development and also good communication skills.

2. Ajeet (another classmate) because he is knowledgeable in both core Android app development and java development.
