In my previous internship, I delivered a full-stack mobile application using React-Native from Scratch. It is similar to the Inshots app but only for crypto news. In which users can check out the latest crypto news as well as a market tab where he/she can check out the top crypto prices, graphs, volume, etc.

As it is an internship project, I am able to share with you the links of the project which is under funding. But i can share you some screenshots of the project.
